# Explainable-AI-projects

Explainability is increasingly becoming a vital aspect of any artificial intelligence/machine learning development. It is not possible for all stakeholders involved in the development cycle to understand the entire functionality of a black box system. However, it is imperative to make some knowledge about their inner workings accessible. 

This project contains four mini-projects, each of which deals with different types of algorithms and models and then tries to extract some explanations for the results they generate. The performance of the models is also measured and analyzed. 

Each of the four projects is described in detail in its respective folder. The project report contains all methodologies, overall results, individual sample analysis, and discussions.
